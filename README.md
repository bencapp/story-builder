# StoryBuilder

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Solo Project_

StoryBuilder is a full stack application that allows users to create stories in collaboration with others and share them with a broader network. The core functionality is a timed writing environment where players take turns writing words or sentences, trying to create the most interesting story in a short amount of time! You can try out the fully functioning app [here](https://story-builder-test.herokuapp.com/).
